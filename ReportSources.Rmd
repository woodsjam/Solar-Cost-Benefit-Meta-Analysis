Found these sources:

+ http://www.seia.org/policy/distributed-solar/solar-cost-benefit-studies


Other "meta" analysis:

+ http://environmentamerica.org/sites/environment/files/reports/EA_shiningrewards_print.pdf Cites 11 C?B studies but does not do stats.
+ http://www.rmi.org/elab_empower Older studies but plenty of references.

Looked in:

+ FERC https://www.ferc.gov/legal/staff-reports.asp?new=sc2  No real database of studies.
+ NERC used search term "solar cost benefit". 290 results but did not see anything.
